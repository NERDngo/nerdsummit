However doing this, can cause many headaches for developers, teams and projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeleting code does not have to be scary, especially when using a code repository such as git. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis talk will explain the benefits of deleting old code from a codebase, how to feel confident doing so and how to best utilize a git repository to keep track of and (if needed) restore deleted code.\u003c/p\u003e",

Forced to constantly adapt to a world not built for them, disability has always driven innovation. From audiobooks in the 1930s to touch screens long before the first iPhone, countless technological advances have emerged from (not for) disabled communities. Yet, history has long repackaged these brilliant designers as recipients and users, not creators, of innovation. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis talk will cover the dark history that propelled the medical model of disability to its modern day prevalence, the Disabled Civil Rights Movement, the endless contributions disabled designers have made to our field, and steps your firm should take when approaching inclusive design. \u003c/p\u003e",
