      "Kosmas Giannoutakis and Aaron Juarez",
      "\u003cp\u003eIn the current turbulent sociopolitical landscape, a reflective contemplation on speculative post-modern futures is a necessity. Dominant notions in music/art-making, such as the genius artist and the musical/artwork, have been long questioned and critiqued, while alternative concepts of musicking and art-making are actively being evaluated in the network, digital, and computational art communities. Live coding is such a practice in which laptop performers code algorithmic processes that are manifested audiovisually in real time. The live coder is already accustomed to a configuration of relationships that include the fluid character of musical improvisation and remix culture, in combination with the identity of the computer musician as an improviser, collaborator, contributor, and commoner. In our approach, we reappropriate creative code by various artists, combined with our own interpretations and aesthetic histories. This practice which we term \"Serendipitous Liquidation,\" can be characterized as entangling its authors' computerized musicality or bringing their digital voices into a conversation. In that way, we propose an audiovisual experience that manifests a communitarian turn and brings closer a social reality based on digital commoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSerendipitous Liquidation describes the practice of live coding that reuses, remixes, and repurposes creative code by various authors in live performances. The limitless aesthetic possibilities of openly published code snippets are harnessed in experimental, improvisatory, and playful modes. This practice paves the way for the development of commons-centric ecosystems that are supported by Distributed Ledger Technologies. The performance engages with SuperCollider tweets and Hydra sketches composed by various creative coders. All the authors are cited on screen and in the credits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this talk we are going to present our live coding practice and present with audiovisual examples and theoretical descriptions.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eIn fields like mechanical and software engineering and data analysis, employers often gripe about the competitive landscape around hiring and retention. And while they may want to make their teams more diverse, how can you get there if you can’t hire enough people? As generally understood, the problem is everyone wants to recruit and retain the best and brightest and there’s simply not enough of these persons. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this framework there’s an assumption that the ‘best and brightest’ come only from a select subset of universities. We disagree. They also come from more accessible and diverse institutions like Roxbury Community College, Springfield Technical Community College, and UMass-Boston. And if employers want  Black and Latine talent, they need to look at where they're being educated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHack.Diversity’s mission is to transform the economy by breaking down barriers for Black and Latine/x professionals in tech. One way we do so is through our fellowship program where we recruit, develop and curate, and place tech talent from more equitable and accessible education pathways into innovative tech ecosystems. These pathways include self-learners, as well as those who attended and/or matriculated from community colleges, public two- and four-year universities, and bootcamps. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d like to hear from you! Assuming a goal is building a more representative team, how are you going about doing so? How are you identifying the need? What strategies or processes are you embracing? Are they successful? And by what measure? Are you tracking your efforts and what effect, if any, are they having on hiring and retention? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe look forward to lively and candid discussion on this topic.
